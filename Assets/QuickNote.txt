Just a note when you're setting things up. I should have the enemy mesh swapping code done and added to the enemy prefab. So it should swap the mesh out for one of the other food prefabs. The player won't, since it needs to be scaled to match the size of the collider. Should be able to add it to the scene, remove the "mesh" object and replace it with the player. I'm adding a "moving" state in the player script so that you can just use that for the animations. Remember that the enemy States are: aggressive and afraid.
